# DesktopDigialClock
This is a simple digital clock app that just displays the current time with large digits.

I needed a clock app that just diplayed the current time to help with debugging some time based tasks, and while
there's plenty of clock apps, I thought I'd create my own to add some other specific features that would be useful.

Potential features to be added later:

- display local and GMT (useful for amateur radio)

- take a copy of the time by clicking it (to be pasted elsewhere)
